# Debug Status - ts-voxel-02

## Status: Integration Complete, Waiting for Manual Test

### What's Been Done ✅

1. **WebSocket Client** (`packages/client/src/network/WebSocketClient.ts`)
   - Migrated from old voxelsrv
   - JSON message protocol
   - Event-based handlers
   - Connection/disconnection handling

2. **Chunk Manager** (`packages/client/src/world/ChunkManager.ts`)
   - Migrated from old voxelsrv
   - Requests chunks in radius around position
   - Caches loaded chunks
   - Triggers rendering

3. **Chunk Renderer** (`packages/client/src/rendering/ChunkRenderer.ts`)
   - Creates Babylon.js meshes from chunk data
   - Simple cube-per-block approach
   - Index formula matches server: `x + y * chunkSize + z * chunkSize * height`
   - Material with stone texture

4. **VoxelClient Integration** (`packages/client/src/VoxelClient.ts`)
   - Creates WebSocket client
   - Creates ChunkManager
   - Connects to server
   - Requests chunks around spawn (0,0) with radius 3
   - Camera positioned at (0, 80, 0)

5. **Server** (`packages/server/src/VoxelServer.ts`)
   - WebSocket server on port 3003
   - Handles `request_chunk` messages
   - Generates/loads chunks
   - Sends chunk data as JSON
   - **VERIFIED WORKING** with test script

6. **Main Menu** (`packages/client/src/gui/MainMenu.ts`)
   - Default values: `localhost` and `3003`
   - Connect button triggers `connectToServer()`

### Test Results ✅

**Server Test (via test-connection.js):**
```
✓ Connected!
Sending: { type: 'request_chunk', chunkX: 0, chunkZ: 0 }
Received: welcome
Received: chunk_data
✓ Chunk data received: 0,0 with 262144 blocks
  Non-air blocks: 64786
```

**Server Logs:**
```
[Server] New client connected
[Server] Received message: request_chunk
[Server] Chunk request: 0, 0
[World:world] Generating chunk 0,0
[Server] Sending chunk 0, 0 with 262144 blocks
[Server] Sent chunk 0, 0
[Server] Client disconnected
```

### Next Steps for Manual Testing

1. **Open Browser:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001
   - Should see Main Menu with VoxelSrv logo

2. **Connect:**
   - Server Name: (any name)
   - Server Address: `localhost` (pre-filled)
   - Server Port: `3003` (pre-filled)
   - Click "Connect to Server"

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Menu disappears
   - WebSocket connects to ws://localhost:3003
   - Client requests 49 chunks (7×7 grid, radius 3 around 0,0)
   - Server generates/sends chunks
   - ChunkRenderer creates meshes
   - Camera shows voxel terrain

4. **Expected Console Output (Browser F12):**
   ```
   [Client] Connecting to server: {name: "...", address: "localhost", port: 3003}
   [Client] Connecting to ws://localhost:3003...
   [WebSocket] Connecting to ws://localhost:3003
   [WebSocket] Connected
   [Client] Connected successfully, requesting chunks...
   [ChunkManager] Requesting chunks around 0,0 (radius 3)
   [ChunkManager] Requesting chunk -3,-3
   [ChunkManager] Requesting chunk -3,-2
   ... (49 chunks total)
   [ChunkManager] Received chunk -3,-3 (262144 blocks)
   [ChunkManager] Rendered chunk -3,-3
   ... (49 chunks total)
   ```

5. **Expected Server Output:**
   ```
   [Server] New client connected
   [Server] Received message: request_chunk
   [Server] Chunk request: -3, -3
   [World:world] Generating chunk -3,-3
   [Server] Sending chunk -3, -3 with 262144 blocks
   [Server] Sent chunk -3, -3
   ... (49 chunks total)
   ```

6. **Expected Visual Result:**
   - Hilly terrain with simplex noise
   - Height variation (base 64, variation ±32)
   - Grass blocks on top
   - Dirt blocks below grass
   - Stone blocks below dirt
   - Sky blue background
   - Camera can be moved with WASD
   - Mouse look around

### Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Performance:**
   - Each chunk = up to 262,144 cubes
   - Each cube = 24 vertices, 12 triangles
   - NO face culling yet (renders all 6 faces per cube)
   - NO greedy meshing yet
   - Browser may freeze during mesh generation
   - FPS may drop significantly

2. **Rendering:**
   - All blocks use same texture (stone.png)
   - No per-block textures yet
   - No lighting/shadows
   - No ambient occlusion
   - Meshes are not optimized

3. **Missing Features:**
   - Player entity (just free camera)
   - Collision detection
   - Physics
   - HUD/GUI during gameplay
   - Chat
   - Inventory
   - Block breaking/placing

### Troubleshooting

**If no connection happens:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify server is running on port 3003
- Check for CORS errors
- Verify WebSocket connection in Network tab

**If connection works but no chunks appear:**
- Check browser console for chunk received messages
- Check for mesh creation errors
- Verify camera position (may be inside solid terrain)
- Check Babylon.js inspector (press F8 in scene)

**If chunks appear but look wrong:**
- Verify index formula matches server
- Check for texture loading errors
- Inspect mesh data in Babylon.js inspector

**If browser freezes:**
- Too many vertices being generated
- Reduce chunk radius (currently 3)
- Implement face culling first
- Implement greedy meshing

### Files to Check

**Client:**
- `packages/client/src/VoxelClient.ts` - Main client entry
- `packages/client/src/network/WebSocketClient.ts` - WebSocket handling
- `packages/client/src/world/ChunkManager.ts` - Chunk loading
- `packages/client/src/rendering/ChunkRenderer.ts` - Mesh generation
- `packages/client/src/gui/MainMenu.ts` - Server selection
- `packages/client/src/main.ts` - App entry point

**Server:**
- `packages/server/src/VoxelServer.ts` - Main server
- `packages/server/src/world/World.ts` - World management
- `packages/server/src/world/generators/NormalWorldGenerator.ts` - Terrain generation

### Port Configuration

- **Client (Vite):** http://localhost:3001
- **Server (WebSocket):** ws://localhost:3003

### Current Code State

**Index Formula (Client & Server MUST match):**
```typescript
const index = x + y * chunkSize + z * chunkSize * height;
```

**Chunk Size:** 32×256×32 (width × height × depth)

**Camera Position:** (0, 80, 0) looking towards (10, 79, 10)

**Chunk Request:** Radius 3 around (0, 0) = 49 chunks in 7×7 grid

### What User Should See

If everything works:
1. Main menu with VoxelSrv branding
2. Pre-filled connection fields
3. After clicking Connect: terrain appears
4. Rolling hills with grass/dirt/stone
5. Ability to fly around with WASD + mouse

If it doesn't work:
- Check browser console (F12)
- Check server logs
- Report error messages
- Take screenshot if needed
